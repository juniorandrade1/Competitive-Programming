Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again. 

    In Sixteen Hundred and Forty-Eight
    When England suffered the pains of state
    The Roundheads lay siege to Colchester town
    Where the King's men still fought for the crown
    There One-Eyed Thompson stood on the wall
    A gunner of deadliest aim of all
    From St. Mary's Tower his cannon he fired
    Humpty-Dumpty was its name
    Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall...
